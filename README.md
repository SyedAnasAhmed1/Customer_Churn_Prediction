# üìä Customer Churn Prediction

## üéØ Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. By analyzing historical customer data, the model will identify customers who are at high risk of churning. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that can help the business proactively retain valuable customers.

## ü§î Problem Statement

Customer churn, or the loss of customers, is a significant challenge for telecommunications companies. It is often more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. Therefore, developing a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning is a key business priority.

---

## üìà Objectives

* **Data Exploration:** Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, including data types, distributions, and potential correlations.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from existing data that may improve model performance.
* **Model Building:** Train and evaluate several machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict customer churn.
* **Model Evaluation:** Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to select the best-performing model.
* **Actionable Insights:** Analyze the final model's results to understand the key factors driving customer churn.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a fictional telecommunications company. It contains customer data including demographics, services signed up for, account information, and whether or not the customer churned.

* **Source:** \[Add dataset link here ‚Äî e.g., Kaggle or UCI Repository]
* **File:** `telco_customer_churn.csv`
